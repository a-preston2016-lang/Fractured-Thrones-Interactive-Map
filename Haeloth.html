                    <h2>Haeloth</h2>
                        <p>Haeloth is a rugged northern realm of hardy Northmen and pioneers, 
                            where bitter cold, ferocious beasts, and roaring ice storms shape every aspect of life. 
                            Governed by King Erland Gunvald and a network of powerful clans such as Brynjar, Dagfinn, and Torvald, 
                            this people have survived by mastering the harsh landscape and embracing resilience as a way of life. 
                            Clad in heavy furs and cloaks, and less welcoming than most, the citizens of Haeloth are fiercely independent, 
                            superstitious, and notoriously distrustful of outsiders—especially non-humans—with even visitors watched closely and seldom treated as equals. 
                            Though their reputation for stubbornness and intolerance has made them hard to befriend, 
                            it has forged a battle-tested populace adept at survival, whose warriors favor round shields, javelins, hand axes, 
                            and chainmail learned through constant conflict with ice trolls, direwolves, and frost giants in the frozen wilderness of the North.</p>
